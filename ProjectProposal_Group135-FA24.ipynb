    "As young college students nearing graduation, understanding loan approval factors is highly relevant to us as we prepare to navigate personal finance and credit. Many young adults, including ourselves, may soon be considering loans, whether for further education, purchasing a car, or other personal investments. Having a clear grasp of the variables that impact loan approvals—such as income, employment length, and debt-to-income ratio—can empower us and others in our age group to make better financial decisions and improve our creditworthiness. This research seeks insights into how employment length, income, and loan amount impact approval likelihoods for young adults (ages 20-24) versus those over 24, highlighting any disparities across age groups. The dataset we chose allows us to analyze these financial factors in depth, aiming to provide actionable insights for young adults interested in securing credit and managing loans more effectively as they start their careers.\n",

    "According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, lenders are prohibited from accepting or denying a loan application solely based on age <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). However, they are allowed to assess an individual’s age in relation to other factors such as job stability to evaluate the sustainability of the loan <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1).

    "This project by Lim Chia Hooi was a loan-approval prediction project that looks to classify whether or not a person will be approved for loans based on their info (applicant income, Coapplicant income, loan amount, loan amount term, credit history, and loan status), and we faced the same question wondering what and how each attribute contributes to the decision of whether or not a loan will be approved  <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). In this project’s exploratory analysis section, they’ve found that there seems to be a correlation between applicant income and loan amount and credit history and loan status <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). In addition to that, they’ve also found that people with credit history are more likely to be approved for a loan <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",

    "We predict that employment history will have a larger negative effect on loan approval for adults aged 20-24 compared to those over the age of 24. Adults aged 20-24 are seen as less reliable to lenders as they are likely fresh out of college with little to no employment history, less stable income, and shorter credit history. "

    "1. Our ideal dataset would have the following variables: age, income, length of employment, loan amount, gender, education, credit history, marital status, assets, number of dependents. There should be at least 10,000 observations to have less bias and variability. This data would be collected on adults over the age of 20. There should be a significant amount of observations for those in the age range 20-24 as well as 24+. This data would be collected off of Kaggle. The data would be stored in a CSV file to make it convenient for creating a dataframe using pandas. \n",

    "We need to consider the privacy of the user as we are keeping track of their age, employment status, gender, and credit history. A potential bias can be that there is a lot more data on younger adults than adults over the age of 24. This would create an underrepresentation of loan applications from adults over the age of 24 and lead to a biased interpretation of the results. Since these datasets don’t have geographical data, there could be socioeconomic biases as it doesn’t take into account that lower-income neighborhoods might be less likely to apply for loans. \n",
