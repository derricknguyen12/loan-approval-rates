# Loan Approval Analysis for Young and Mid-Career Adults

## Abstract

This project investigates how employment length, income, loan amount, and education level affect loan approval rates for young adults (ages 18-28) compared to mid-career adults (ages 28-38). With a focus on education levels (high school diploma, bachelor’s degree, master’s/PhD), we aim to uncover trends that provide actionable insights for young borrowers and improve financial literacy. Using statistical tests and data visualizations, we explored the significance of various factors influencing loan approvals and repayment behavior.

## Reasearch Question

* How do employment length, income, and loan amount affect loan approval rates for young adults with varying educational levels?
* How do these effects compare to mid-career adults with similar education?

## Hypothesis

Young adults with higher education levels (master’s/PhD) would have higher home mortgage approval rates. However, mid-career adults (28+) were predicted to have higher overall approval rates due to job stability and experience.

## Dataset

Name: Loan Default Prediction Dataset
Source: Kaggle Dataset
Observations: 255,347
Variables: 18
Link: 

Key variables analyzed include:
  - Age (proxy for life stage/income potential)
  - Income (financial stability)
  - LoanAmount (affordability/risk)
  - MonthsEmployed (job stability)
  - Education (employability/earning potential)
  - EmploymentType (income predictability)
  - LoanPurpose (risk)
  - Default (loan repayment binary)

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning
- Removed unnecessary columns.
- Identified and resolved outliers and missing values.
- Standardized units and corrected typos in categorical variables.

### Analysis Techniques:
- Generated scatter plots for relationships (e.g., Age vs. Income, LoanAmount).
- Conducted T-tests to determine statistical significance between groups.
- Bar plots visualized loan purposes by age group.

## Results

- No significant differences in loan amounts based on education level.
- Mid-career adults are more likely to repay loans than young adults, likely due to greater financial stability.
- Income, months employed, and loan purpose were significant predictors of loan approval.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights that while education level may not strongly influence loan amounts, factors like age, income, and job stability play significant roles in loan approvals. Our findings provide insights for young borrowers to better understand and improve their financial profiles.
